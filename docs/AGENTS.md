# Coucou — third-party agent integration

Any tool that can write to a Unix domain socket (macOS, Linux) or a named pipe (Windows) can send events to Coucou and have its own pill next to Claude Code.

## The `coucou_agent` field

Add the optional field `coucou_agent` to any hook JSON payload. Coucou will create a pill labelled with the agent name and route all events to it.

**Validation:** the name must match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,24}$` (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–24 characters). An absent or invalid name routes the event to the Claude Code pill instead.

## Hook command (macOS)

Configure your tool to call the Coucou relay with `--agent <your-name>` after the hook executable:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/nb-hook --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The shell wrapper passes `"$@"` to the Python relay, which extracts the agent name and injects it into the payload before forwarding to Coucou.

## Hook command (Windows)

Same pattern with the Windows relay:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\coucou-hook.exe --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook command (Linux)

Same pattern with the Linux relay. Coucou copies the relay to `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook` at startup.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/coucou-hook --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Payload format

The relay adds `coucou_agent` to the JSON it forwards. You can also add it yourself if you talk to the socket directly:

```json
{
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "session_id": "my-session-1",
  "coucou_agent": "my-tool",
  "prompt": "Running task…"
}
```

Send newline-terminated JSON to the socket:
- **macOS (GitHub build):** `~/Library/Application Support/NotchBuddy/nb.sock`
- **macOS (App Store build):** `~/Library/Containers/fr.louisraille.Coucou/Data/nb.sock`
- **Windows:** `\\.\pipe\coucou-<user-SID>`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/coucou.sock` (usually `/run/user/<uid>/coucou.sock`). Only your own user account can connect.

## Supported events

All standard Claude Code hook events are supported, **except `PermissionRequest`**:
approval cards are not yet implemented for third-party agents (only Claude Code gets
one). A `PermissionRequest` from an external agent is answered immediately with no
decision, so the relay writes nothing and the agent re-asks in its terminal.
Approval support for other agents will be added with Codex support.

The pill lifecycle:

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Creates the pill (if absent), sets state to idle |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | State → thinking; prompt shown in ticker |
| `PreToolUse` | State → working; tool label shown in ticker |
| `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` | State → working |
| `Notification` | Rate-limit or question state if applicable |
| `Stop` | State → finished for 5 s; active declared pills (catalog + checked in Settings) reset to idle — all others are removed |
| `StopFailure` | State → error |
| `SessionEnd` | Active declared pills (catalog + checked in Settings) reset to idle — all others are removed |
| `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` | Step added to ticker |

## Declared pills

A **declared pill** is a catalog entry (`PillCatalog.swift`) that has been enabled in **Settings → Active pills**. When a session ends for a declared pill, the pill stays visible and resets to idle instead of disappearing.

A catalog pill that is not checked in Settings behaves like any other agent: it gets an automatic pill when a session starts, and that pill is removed when the session ends.

The GitHub build exposes Gemini CLI (`agent_gemini`), Antigravity (`agent_antigravity`),
GitHub Copilot CLI (`agent_copilot`), Muse Code (`agent_muse`), OpenCode (`agent_opencode`),
Amp (`agent_amp`) and Hermes (`agent_hermes`) in Settings → Active pills. Cursor (`agent_cursor`) and Codex
(`agent_codex`, GitHub build only) are there too — their pills can be declared and set as
the main pill; session support is coming in a future version.

Claude Desktop (`agent_claude-desktop`, every build) is there as well. Claude Code sessions started from the Claude desktop app's Code tab carry `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-desktop`; the relay tags them `coucou_agent: claude-desktop` on its own (an explicit `--agent` still wins), so nothing extra is installed. Declare the pill to keep it after the session ends; the ↗ button opens the Claude app.

## Real-world examples

### Gemini CLI (macOS)

Coucou supports Gemini CLI out of the box via **Settings → Gemini CLI → Install hooks**.
The installer writes to `~/.gemini/settings.json` and uses `--agent gemini` so
Gemini sessions get their own pill. The relay translates Gemini event names to canonical
Coucou events automatically.

| Gemini CLI event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `BeforeTool` | `PreToolUse` |
| `AfterTool` | `PostToolUse` |
| `BeforeAgent` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `AfterAgent` | `Stop` |

`AfterModel` is not installed — it fires on every response chunk and would flood the island.

### Antigravity — `agy` (macOS)

Coucou supports Antigravity out of the box via **Settings → Antigravity → Install hooks**.
The installer writes to `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (timeouts in seconds) and uses
`--agent antigravity`. The relay translates `toolCall.name` / `conversationId` to the
island's `tool_name` / `session_id`.

| Antigravity event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `PreInvocation` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `PreToolUse` | `PreToolUse` |
| `PostToolUse` | `PostToolUse` |
| `PostInvocation` | `PostToolUse` |
| `Stop` | `Stop` |

### GitHub Copilot CLI (macOS)

Coucou supports Copilot CLI out of the box via **Settings → GitHub Copilot CLI Hooks → Install hooks**.
The installer writes to `~/.copilot/hooks/coucou.json` and uses `--agent copilot`.
Copilot CLI uses camelCase event names and `{"bash":"…","timeoutSec":N}` entries.
Copilot CLI is fail-closed on `permissionRequest`: the relay always outputs valid JSON
and returns `{"permissionDecision":"ask"}` on timeout so Copilot re-prompts in the terminal.
Coucou shows a real Allow / Deny card for Copilot approval requests.

| Copilot CLI event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `sessionStart` | `SessionStart` |
| `userPromptSubmitted` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `preToolUse` | `PreToolUse` |
| `permissionRequest` | `PermissionRequest` |
| `postToolUse` | `PostToolUse` |
| `agentStop` | `Stop` |
| `sessionEnd` | `SessionEnd` |
| `notification` | `Notification` |

### Muse Code (macOS)

Coucou supports Muse Code out of the box via **Settings → Muse Code Hooks → Install hooks**.
The installer merges into `~/.config/muse/settings.json` and uses `--agent muse`.
Muse uses PascalCase event names. Coucou shows a real Allow / Deny card for Muse approval requests.

| Muse Code event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `SessionStart` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `PreToolUse` | `PreToolUse` |
| `PermissionRequest` | `PermissionRequest` |
| `PostToolUse` | `PostToolUse` |
| `Stop` | `Stop` |
| `SessionEnd` | `SessionEnd` |

### OpenCode (macOS)

Coucou supports OpenCode via **Settings → OpenCode Plugin → Install plugin**.
The installer writes a JS plugin to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/coucou.js`.
The plugin maps OpenCode event types to canonical Coucou names and forwards them fire-and-forget; OpenCode is never blocked.

| OpenCode event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `session.created` | `SessionStart` |
| `session.idle` | `Stop` |
| `session.error` | `StopFailure` |
| `session.deleted` | `SessionEnd` |
| `tool.execute.before` | `PreToolUse` |
| `tool.execute.after` | `PostToolUse` |
| `permission.asked` | `PermissionRequest` |

### Amp (macOS)

Coucou supports Amp via **Settings → Amp Plugin → Install plugin**.
The installer writes a TypeScript plugin to `~/.config/amp/plugins/coucou.ts`.
The `tool.call` handler returns `{ action: 'allow' }` so Amp always proceeds; all events are forwarded display-only.

| Amp event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `session.start` | `SessionStart` |
| `agent.start` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `tool.call` | `PreToolUse` |
| `tool.result` | `PostToolUse` |
| `agent.end` | `Stop` |

### Hermes Agent (macOS)

Coucou supports Hermes via **Settings → Agents → Hermes → Install plugin**.
The installer writes a Python plugin to `~/.hermes/plugins/coucou/` and enables it in
`~/.hermes/config.yaml`. The plugin uses `on_session_start` (sends the platform when running
via the gateway), `post_llm_call` (sends the final response), and a `pre_approval_request`
observer hook that fires a `⏳ Approval pending in Hermes` step in the notch.
Approving from the notch requires `register_approval_transport`, which is not yet available
in Hermes 0.15.x; the Approvals toggle activates automatically once Hermes exposes it.
Every event is fire-and-forget: if the app is closed or unreachable, nothing is sent and Hermes carries on, handling approvals itself.

| Hermes event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `on_session_start` | `SessionStart` |
| `post_llm_call` | `Stop` |
| `pre_approval_request` | `PreToolUse` (observer only, shows "⏳ Approval pending in Hermes") |

### Any other tool

Follow the generic pattern: call `nb-hook --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (macOS),
`coucou-hook.exe --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (Windows)
or `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (Linux)
and let the relay forward the event.

## Quick test (Linux)

With Coucou running:

```sh
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","session_id":"t1","prompt":"hello","coucou_agent":"demo"}' \
  | ~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook --agent demo
```

A "demo" pill should appear in the island.

## Quick test (macOS)

With Coucou running:

```sh
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","session_id":"t1","prompt":"hello","coucou_agent":"demo"}' \
  | /bin/sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/NotchBuddy/nb-hook --agent demo
```

A "demo" pill should appear in the island.
