# Changelog

## Windows and Linux 0.2.0 — unreleased

The Windows and Linux app catches up with the Mac, from 0.1.1 to 0.2.1 — everything except Apple Music and the iPhone, which depend on macOS and iCloud.

- **Agents**: Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI and Muse Code sessions with Allow / Deny in the island; Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor Agent, OpenCode, Amp and Hermes sessions on their own pills; Claude Code sessions from the Claude app on Windows. Install them all from Settings → Agents, which shows the diff and takes a dated backup before writing — one hardened writer for every agent's config (#278 by @Totopo27, #298 by @kobaltgit, #231 by @BeyondBirthday07)
- **Questions**: answer Claude Code's multiple-choice questions from the island; answers are checked against the questions asked, and a question answered in the terminal takes the card down (#216 by @PythonTilk)
- **The permission card** comes up for every agent, brings its pill forward, can be folded without answering, and never decides on its own
- **Chat**: Anthropic, Google AI, OpenAI and OpenRouter, switchable by clicking the model name; local models through Ollama, LM Studio or any OpenAI-compatible server, streamed, thinking hidden; Markdown answers with a copy button; full answers; your first name in the greeting; `COUCOU_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for a gateway, https only (#161 by @4rchila, #166 by @AlphaIsYour, #173 by @AinzDerErste, #206 by @Totopo27)
- **Plan usage**: Claude's 5-hour and weekly limits and Codex's, in the island header (#171 by @AinzDerErste)
- **Live diff**: each file Claude edits shows in the ticker with its +N −M, and a click opens the diff; the finished card shows Claude's final message
- **GitHub**: your pull requests with their CI, reviews waiting for you, the CI of your default branches, alerts when CI turns red or green, and your contribution grid
- **Mochi**: the wardrobe and seasonal outfits, the new greeting and its sound, and Mochi on the desktop (Windows, X11 and layer-shell compositors)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** from anywhere, changeable in Settings → Shortcuts; the defaults never type an AltGr character on French, German, Spanish, Italian or Portuguese keyboards
- **Weekly recap** on Monday mornings, shareable as an image; history stays on your computer
- **Pills**: declare the tools you use and pick your main one; hook-based pills no longer ask for a key; "Open terminal" brings the session's own window forward on Windows
- **10 languages**: English, 中文, हिन्दी, Español, العربية, Français, বাংলা, Português (Brasil), Русский, Bahasa Indonesia — Settings → General → Language (#228; picker from #226 by @alexisrja)
- **File drop** works from every Explorer view, and Cancel works (#240 by @KauaDc, #126); only files a real drop delivered can be read
- **Linux**: auto-close on KDE/Wayland and GNOME (#160 by @4rchila, #136), the island at the top on GNOME (#149 by @betodoescher), pinned to its display on Hyprland and Sway with a display picker (#227 by @chuxclay), GNOME large text no longer cuts the island (#122), an Arch Linux PKGBUILD (#299 by @FabioLukas123, #230)
- The step ticker no longer stops at a session's 20th step (#265 by @PythonTilk), ticker steps keep their own line (from #203 by @shakibbinkabir), `tauri dev` no longer crashes on EBUSY (#202 by @Andrev-91)

## 0.2.1 — October 7, 2026

- **Hermes Agent** (Nous Research, open-source): sessions appear in the notch — live tool steps, the final response when done, and the platform (Telegram, Discord…) when running via the gateway. Install from Settings → Agents → Hermes: it writes a small Python plugin to `~/.hermes/plugins/coucou/` and enables it in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, with the same preview, backup and confirmation flow as other agents *(macOS, GitHub build)* (#288)
- Hermes approval requests show a "⏳ Approval pending in Hermes" step in the notch. Approving directly from the notch isn't supported yet — current Hermes versions (0.15.x) don't expose the transport API. The Approvals toggle in Settings will activate automatically once Hermes adds it (#288)
- Coucou never blocks Hermes: if the app is closed or unreachable, Hermes continues normally and handles approvals itself (#288)

## 0.2.0 — October 6, 2026

- GitHub Copilot CLI and Muse Code sessions show up in the notch: see every step live and approve or deny permissions right from the island. Install from Settings → Agents → Copilot CLI / Muse Code, which shows what will change in your config and backs it up before writing *(GitHub build)* (#263)
- OpenCode sessions appear in the notch via a small JavaScript plugin: install it from Settings → Agents → OpenCode. Same installer flow — preview, backup, confirm. OpenCode never blocks on the plugin (fire-and-forget), so Coucou never slows it down *(macOS, GitHub build)* (#263)
- Amp sessions appear in the notch the same way, via a TypeScript plugin: Settings → Agents → Amp *(macOS, GitHub build)* (#263)
- Weekly recap: on Monday morning, the first time an agent starts working or your Mac wakes, Coucou shows a card for the past week — time spent, sessions, files and lines changed, commands run, permissions and questions, plus your top agent, top project, busiest day and longest session. Open it any time from the menu bar with "Weekly recap" (#264)
- Share your week as a 1080 × 1920 image with Mochi: copy it, save it or share it from the notch. A privacy toggle lets you hide project names before sharing (#264)
- Everything stays on your Mac: the recap reads from a local history file (12-week rolling window) that never leaves your machine. Clear it any time in Settings → General → Weekly recap (#264)
- Coucou now speaks English, 中文, हिन्दी, Español, العربية, Français, বাংলা, Português, Русский and Bahasa Indonesia. Pick your language in Settings → General → Language, independent of your system locale. Translations welcome — open a pull request (#268)

## 0.1.9 — October 6, 2026

- Services up close on the iPhone: tap a service and your Mac fetches live data from its API — Vercel, GitHub, Stripe, Resend, Cal.com, n8n and Notion. The keys never leave the Mac; the detail is written to your iCloud encrypted (#251)
- Act from the iPhone: Vercel (redeploy, promote to production, cancel a build), GitHub (re-run failed jobs, approve, squash and merge), n8n (activate, deactivate, retry a failed run). Each action runs only if it was offered on an item in the last detail the Mac published for that service, is used once, and must be less than 5 minutes old. Nothing that moves money or sends an email (#251)
- The Live Activity starts 20 seconds after the Mac locks, not immediately, so a quick lock and unlock doesn't spend one of iOS's hourly starts. It starts right away when an agent is waiting for a permission or has a question (#251)
- After unlocking, the Live Activity waits 30 seconds before ending, in case the Mac locks again — useful on a laptop that goes to sleep the moment you put it down (#251)
- If the iPhone has no update token yet (iOS held back the start), and an approval or question is waiting, the Mac starts the activity again once for that specific request (#251)
- Cal.com upcoming bookings work again: the API v2 expects `afterStart` / `beforeEnd`, not `start` / `end`, so the bookings page was empty (#251)

## 0.1.8 — October 5, 2026

- Coucou on iPhone: turn on Settings → General → iPhone (off by default) and your agent sessions show up live in the Coucou iPhone app and its widgets, through your own private iCloud. Project names, commands and questions are encrypted with your iCloud keys; turning it off deletes them (#209, #211, #212, #213)
- Allow or deny a permission from the iPhone: a notification with the command, Deny right from it, Allow behind Face ID. Your Mac only applies a decision meant for the exact request it is waiting on, and the request expires after 2 minutes. The iPhone keeps a history of your decisions (#220)
- Lock your Mac while an agent works and Mochi moves to your iPhone's Lock Screen and Dynamic Island, then comes back to the notch when you unlock. Turn it on under Settings → General → iPhone. It goes through a small relay that only sees the agent's name and state (#221)
- Mochi, the pills and the diff engine now live in a shared package used by both apps; nothing changes in the notch (#210)
- The iPhone sees more of what your Mac sees: every service Mochi (GitHub, Stripe, Vercel, Resend, Cal.com, n8n, Notion) with its latest items, and the last turn of each session with its commands and diffs, all encrypted with your iCloud keys. No API key ever leaves the Mac (#224)
- Send the next instruction to Claude Code from the iPhone (GitHub build, off by default): your Mac picks it up within 15 seconds and continues the session in its own folder (#224)
- Answer Claude's questions from the iPhone: your Mac applies an answer only if it matches the question still waiting (#241)
- The Live Activity counts the time since Mochi left, and shows Allow and Deny while a command waits for you (#232, #241)
- A new coucou sound for Mochi's greeting (#241)

## 0.1.7 — October 4, 2026

- Keyboard shortcuts from anywhere: ⌃⌥Space opens the chat, ⌃⌥A jumps to a waiting permission or question, ⌃⌥T brings your terminal forward, ⌃⌥] and ⌃⌥[ switch pills, ⌃⌥M mutes Mochi, ⌃⌥D sends him to the desktop and back, ⌃⌥G opens the wardrobe, and ⌃⌥W attaches the front window to the chat (GitHub build) (#205)
- In the open island: ⌘← ⌘→ and ⌘1–9 switch pills, ⌘↑ ⌘↓ and ⌘O move through a card's list, ⌘E opens the diff, ⌘↩ sends, ⌘K starts a new chat, ⌘P pins the island (#205)
- Every global shortcut can be changed or turned off in Settings → Shortcuts, which also flags combinations another app already uses. They need no Accessibility permission (#205)
- ⌘⇧N now opens and closes the island (#205)

## 0.1.6 — October 4, 2026

- Mochi on the desktop: drag him out of the notch and drop him anywhere on your desktop. He hangs out there, follows your cursor with his eyes, wears his outfit and dances to your music (#198)
- When Claude needs you, he flies back to the notch with the permission or the question, then returns to his spot once you answer. He does a happy jump when a task finishes (#198)
- Click him to poke him, right-click for the wardrobe, drop him on a window to attach it to the chat (GitHub build), and drop him on the notch or double-click him to bring him home (#198)
- He falls asleep when nothing is going on, and remembers his spot between launches (#198)

## 0.1.5 — October 4, 2026

- Dress Mochi up: right-click him to open the wardrobe and pick a party hat, beanie, crown, witch hat, Santa hat, bunny ears, bow, sunglasses, round glasses, scarf or pumpkin, all drawn in code (#195)
- Auto mode dresses Mochi for the seasons on his own (#195)
- Outfits follow his head in 3D, glasses stay on his eyes, soft parts react when you tap or move him, and outfits come and go with a transition. Only the main Mochi wears them (#195)
- A new launch greeting: Mochi drops into the island, bounces, slides to the side and waves hello with a quick little hand, then comes back, with a new soft whisper of a sound (#196)
- Mochi's body is no longer clipped at two corners during the greeting (#196)

## 0.1.4 — October 3, 2026

- See what Claude is editing, live: each file edit shows up in the session ticker with its +N −M lines, and a click opens the diff right in the notch (#177)
- When Claude finishes, the session card shows its final message instead of the last step, without the shimmer (#177, #179)
- GitHub pill: your open pull requests with their CI status, the pull requests waiting for your review, and the CI of the default branch of your recent repos. Click a row for the list, then an item to open it on github.com (#181)
- GitHub alerts: a badge and a sound when the CI of one of your pull requests turns red or green, when a default branch breaks, or when someone requests your review. Fast CI runs are caught too, and the card refreshes when you open it (#181, #185)
- Your GitHub contribution grid: the last 7 days in the GitHub card header, click it for the past 23 weeks, and click a day for its count (#187)
- The GitHub token needs read access to pull requests and CI: a classic token with the repo scope, or a fine-grained token with read access to Pull requests, Commit statuses and Actions (#181)
- The finished view no longer overflows the card (#179)

## 0.1.3 — October 3, 2026

- Answer Claude's questions from the notch: when Claude Code asks a multiple-choice question, pick an option or type your own answer right in the island, and Reply in terminal hands it back. Update your hooks in Settings to turn it on (#165) — thanks @Vega8991 for the idea (#94)
- Claude plan usage (GitHub build): turn on Settings → Agents → Plan usage to see your 5-hour and weekly limits in a small pill in the notch header, and click it for the details and reset times. Pro and Max plans; your current status line keeps working (#159)
- Chat with local models through Ollama or LM Studio, no API key needed: connect them in Settings → Chat → Local models. Answers stream in, and thinking blocks stay hidden (#156)
- Markdown in chat answers: bold, lists, headings, quotes, and code blocks with a copy button. Links open only when they are web links (#156)
- Apple Music (GitHub build): see what is playing in the notch, play, pause and skip on hover, and Mochi dances along (#144, #153)
- Settings are now organized in a sidebar (#153)
- The chat greets you by your own first name (#154)

## 0.1.2 — October 2, 2026

- Codex support (GitHub build): sessions show up live on the Codex pill, and permission requests get Allow and Deny in the notch. Install from Settings → Codex Hooks, then trust the hooks once with /hooks in Codex (#130) — thanks @lacatu5
- Cursor: Claude Code started in Cursor's terminal shows up on the Cursor pill, and you can answer its permission requests from the notch (#120).
- Pick your main coding tool in Settings → Active pills: VS Code, Cursor, Codex or Antigravity (Codex and Antigravity: GitHub build). It stays on and no longer takes one of the 4 slots (#120).
- The permission card stays in the notch until you answer it: the mouse no longer folds it, and reopening the island shows the request again (#117).
- The permission card also shows when the island is already open, and the pill you were on comes back once you answer (#120).

## 0.1.1 — October 2, 2026

- Declare the tools you use in Settings: Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Anthropic, Google AI and OpenAI pills join the existing ones (Cursor and Codex pills are coming soon), and you pick the main pill.
- Chat now supports Google AI (Gemini) and OpenAI in addition to Anthropic; switch provider and model by clicking the model name in the chat view, on macOS.
- Linux version: the Tauri app now builds for Linux too (AppImage, .deb, .rpm), with the island as a layer-shell overlay on Wayland and Claude Code hooks over a private Unix socket (#21) — thanks @Davy133
- Compact island on screens without a notch (#22) — thanks @Kamasoutra
- Only web links (http/https) open from the notch; other kinds of links from Claude or integrations are ignored (#16) — thanks @Cris1670
- Hook socket limited to your own user account, with size and time limits; logs no longer keep commands, n8n data or full URLs, and stay under 1 MB (#16) — thanks @Cris1670 and @Vignesh-Thangamariappan
- The island always reopens after folding, and Settings opens below it, resizable — thanks @rouderz
- Choose the Claude model for the chat in Settings; the list comes from your Anthropic account, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 stays the default — thanks @rouderz
- Windows build artifacts are now downloadable from a manual CI run — thanks @MysJofR
- Any agent can talk to Mochi: tag a hook payload with `coucou_agent` (e.g. `nb-hook --agent my-agent`) and it gets its own pill in the island (#7, #9) — thanks @lacatu5
- Gemini CLI and Antigravity (agy) hook support on macOS: install from Settings and their sessions show up in the island — thanks @corefusiion
